# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Vizz-Streamlit

## This project focuses on visualizing data from PhonePe, a popular digital payment platform. The goal of this visualization project is to gain insights into the transactions made through PhonePe, including the total number of transactions, the total transaction amount, and the subcategories of PhonePe usage.

By analyzing and presenting this data visually, we can better understand how PhonePe is being utilized and uncover patterns or trends within the transactions. This visualization can provide valuable insights for individuals, businesses, and researchers interested in the digital payment landscape.

Through interactive charts, graphs, and other visual elements, we aim to present the PhonePe data in an intuitive and engaging manner. By exploring the visualization, users will be able to grasp the magnitude of transactions, identify popular subcategories of transactions, and make data-informed decisions.

The project utilizes data visualization techniques and tools to transform raw PhonePe data into meaningful visual representations. By leveraging these techniques, we can extract actionable information from the data and present it in an easily understandable format.

Overall, this PhonePe data visualization project serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the transaction patterns, trends, and usage categories within the PhonePe digital payment ecosystem
